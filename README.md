📧 Spam Mail Detection Using Machine Learning
This project is a machine learning solution to automatically detect whether an email is spam or not spam based on its content. Spam detection is a crucial part of email systems to filter out unwanted or harmful messages.

🎯 Objective
To build a model that can classify incoming emails into two categories:

📩 Ham (Not Spam)

🚫 Spam
⚙️ Tools & Technologies
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

NLTK / spaCy (for text preprocessing)

CountVectorizer / TfidfVectorizer

Matplotlib, Seaborn

🛠 Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Text cleaning (removal of stopwords, punctuation, special characters)

Lowercasing

Tokenization and Lemmatization

Feature Extraction:

Convert text to numerical vectors using CountVectorizer or TF-IDF

Model Training:

Naive Bayes

Logistic Regression

SVM

Evaluation:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion Matrix

🧪 Model Accuracy (Sample)
Model	Accuracy
Naive Bayes	97%
Logistic Regression	96%
SVM	95%
✅ Conclusion
The model effectively detects spam emails with high accuracy. It can be integrated into email systems or used as a standalone tool for spam filtering.

📌 Future Improvements
Use deep learning models (e.g., LSTM or BERT)

Deploy the model with a web interface using Flask/Streamlit

Improve accuracy on imbalanced datasets
