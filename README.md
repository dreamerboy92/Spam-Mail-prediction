# 📧 Spam Mail Detection using Machine Learning

![Spam Mail Detection Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/900x300.png?text=Spam+Mail+Detection+Project)

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)**. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms to detect spam messages from raw text.

## 🧠 What is Spam Detection?

Spam detection is the process of identifying unwanted, unsolicited, and potentially harmful email messages. With millions of spam emails sent daily, automating this detection is essential for user protection and productivity.

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection** – Public dataset of labeled emails (Spam/Ham)
2. **Text Preprocessing** – Cleaning, lowercasing, removing punctuation, stopwords
3. **Feature Extraction** – TF-IDF Vectorization
4. **Model Building** – Train models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)
5. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
6. **Prediction** – Classify new/unseen emails as Spam or Ham
